PLAGIARISM
Plagiarism is the act of utilizing someone else's work, concepts, or expressions without acknowledging or seeking permission and presenting them as one's own. It involves copying or closely emulating the written or creative output of others without proper attribution. Plagiarism is seen as unethical and a violation of intellectual honesty as it involves dishonesty and misrepresentation. It undermines the principles of academic integrity and can have severe consequences in various domains such as education, journalism, publishing, and research. To avoid plagiarism, it is crucial to appropriately attribute and reference all sources, quotes, or citations used in one's work. This requires including in-text citations and generating a comprehensive bibliography or reference list, demonstrating respect for the original authors and maintaining academic integrity.
