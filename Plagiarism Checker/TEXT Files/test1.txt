PLAGIARISM
Plagiarism refers to the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or words without proper attribution or permission and presenting them as your own. It involves copying or closely imitating another person's written or creative content without acknowledging the original source. Plagiarism is considered unethical and a violation of intellectual integrity since it entails dishonesty and misrepresentation. It undermines the principles of academic and creative honesty and can have serious consequences in various fields, including education, journalism, publishing, and research. To avoid plagiarism, it is crucial to appropriately attribute and cite all sources, quotes, or references used in your work. This entails providing in-text citations and creating a comprehensive bibliography or reference list, demonstrating respect for the intellectual property rights of others and maintaining academic integrity.
