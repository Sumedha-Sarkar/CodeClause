PLAGIARISM
Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or words without giving them proper credit or permission and presenting them as your own. It involves copying and pasting or closely imitating someone else's written or creative work, such as articles, essays, research papers, artwork, music, or even computer code, without acknowledging the original source.
Plagiarism is considered unethical and a breach of intellectual integrity because it involves dishonesty and the misrepresentation of one's own efforts. It undermines the principles of academic and creative honesty and can have serious consequences in various fields, including education, journalism, publishing, and research
To avoid plagiarism, it is essential to properly attribute and cite any sources, quotes, or references used in your work. This includes providing in-text citations and creating a comprehensive bibliography or reference list. By acknowledging the original authors and creators, you demonstrate respect for their intellectual property rights and maintain academic integrity.
